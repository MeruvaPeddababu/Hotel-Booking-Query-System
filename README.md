Overview

This project is a Hotel Booking Query System that provides analytics reports and allows users to ask questions about hotel booking data. It integrates LLM-based responses with precomputed analytics and a vector database for efficient retrieval.

Features

LLM Integration: Uses OpenRouter API (LLaMA 3) for answering queries.

Precomputed Analytics: Provides revenue trends, top booking countries, and lead time distributions.

Vector Search with ChromaDB: Retrieves relevant booking records based on user queries.

Interactive Web UI: Built with Gradio for an intuitive user experience.

Chat History: Stores and displays past interactions.
